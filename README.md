# BME450_FinalProject
Final project for B Me 450 Intro to Ocean Engineering and Sciences. 

This project was intended to test the experimental question of
What parameters effect nutrient levels in the ocean?

The .csv files are data pulled from OOI data base. More specifically
data from the coastal endurance Washington offshore surface mooring 
surface bouy. The data is taken over the month of January 2019. 

The finalprojectdata.csv file is used in the phython code to find the final graphs of 
nitrate concentration vs temperature, salinity, and pressure. The resolution of the original data files are
reduced in the final data file from the original data files for ease of analysis.


The Finalprojectcode.ipynb file is the phython code for generating the graphs and statistical data
of the finalprojectdata.csv file. 

The results from the data suggest little to no correlation between nitrate levels and pressure and temperature but a moderate
correlation between nitrate levels and salinity. The moderate correlation suggests that
as salinity levels increases nitrate levels increase. The results may change with higher resolution (more data points).
