# BME450_FinalProject
Final project for B Me 450 Intro to Ocean Engineering and Sciences. 

This project was intended to test the experimental question of
How does wind speed affect surface wave properties?

The .csv files are data pulled from OOI data base. More specifically
data from the coastal endurance Washington offshore surface mooring 
surface bouy. The data is taken over the month of Feburary 2019. 

The finaldata.csv file is used in the phython code to find the final graphs of 
Wind speed vs wave height and wave period. The resolution of the original data files are
reduced in the final data file fromt the original data files for ease of analysis.


The Finalprojectcode.ipynb file is the phython code for generating the graphs and statistical data
of the finaldata.csv file. 

The results from the data suggest little to no correlation between wind speed and wave height but a moderate
correlation between wind speed and wave period. The moderate correlation suggests that
as wind speed increases wave period decreases. The results may change with higher resolution (more data points).
